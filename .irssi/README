This theme got a bit out of hand, you might call it a total conversion ;)

The name:

  I called it dot-irssi in the custom of DJB's dot-files and cras thought
  I meant the theme should he called it dot. Alright it's a nice name.

This version:

  This time I removed all my personal settings that don't involve in
  your settings. Supposed to be cleaner.


Installing it:

  Do make a backup of your .irssi files before you start.

  This is a complete config since that's the easiest. mv the dot-irssi dir
  to .irssi and try if you like the setup. You can also paste in your own
  setting in the right places.

  You may also want to use the scripts I downloaded from irssi.org

First use:

  Well ehm quite simple.

    /connect freenode
    M-2 ( that's alt-2 )
    /join test

  If you get stuck with a window in the wrong place (up) you have to type:

    /window move down
